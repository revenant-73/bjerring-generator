## How to Run a Bjerring Tournament

1. **Setup:** Count your players and set up the recommended number of courts.
2. **Number Players:** Assign each player a unique number (1-16). Record player number and name on a whiteboard or clipboard for reference.
3. **Track Scores:** Set up a whiteboard or large sheet of paper with all player numbers. After each round, add each player's points to their cumulative score.
4. **Timing:** You can run the entire tournament in one session (typically 1-3 hours depending on player count) or spread rounds across multiple practices.
5. **Rotation:** After each round, players find their new partners and opponents according to the schedule.
6. **Sitting Players:** For odd-numbered player counts, some players will sit out each round. They can serve as scorekeepers or help with court management.
7. **Celebration:** At the end, recognize the player with the highest cumulative score as the tournament champion!
